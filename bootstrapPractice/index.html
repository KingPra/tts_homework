              Currently my favorite page design style is minimalism. Tho it's
              clean and efficient, it does take a lot of thought an an eye for
              design to bring all the elements of the page to life.

            <div class="col-md-2">
              <h2 class="display-7">Color Of Choice</h2>
              My color of choice is shades of grey. Dark gray, light gray, extra
              light gray, extra extra light gray, darker gray, almost black
              gray, almost white gray, extra gray. I'm simple like that.

              <h2 class="display-7">Planning...Or Not</h2>
              One of the many skills I'd like to be more proficient at is
              learning how to plan. This is a skill that I currently lack and I
              can see many cases where this would save an abundance of time
              during the life cycle of a project.

              <h2 class="display-7">Code Golfing</h2>
              I really enjoy algorithms and "Code Golfing"- the process of
              refactoring code and making it shorter. Short and beautiful.

              <h2 class="display-4 font-weight-normal">Closing</h2>
              If you've made it this far, you'll see that I didn't plan this out
              very well. Hence, I need to work on planning. It's almost lunch
              time.
